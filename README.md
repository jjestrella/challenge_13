# Venture Funding with Deep Learning

## Instructions:

This code is broken out into the following sections:

* Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.

* Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.

* Optimize the neural network model.

### Prepare the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model 

Using my knowledge of Pandas and scikit-learnâ€™s `StandardScaler()`. I worked on preprocessing the dataset to use it, compile and evaluate the neural network model later.
